<h3>Validating Your Code</h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways to earn a great grade in these modules... validate your code! With HTML5, the standards are so much more relaxed than with XHTML 1.0, but you still need to make sure that your code works against the W3C's standards.</p>
<div style="border: thin black solid; padding: 25px 25px 25px 25px;">
<p><em>Lesson Objective: At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Explain the importance of consistently developing to a single W3C standard.</em></li>
<li><em>Create a Web page using the HTML5 standard.</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So why validate?&nbsp; My number one reason is that as you move forward through the topics of the certificate you will be working with parts and pieces of your Web documents through the Document Object Model (DOM).&nbsp; Validation insures that you can access the different pieces of your document cleanly and easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Number two, the best way to start having your pages render consistently across browsers is with standardized code.&nbsp; Even IE is better when using W3C standards.</p>
<p>There are a lot more reasons, please read the article Why Validate? provided by the W3C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps to validating your code at the W3C's validator by Direct Input:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access the W3C's validator at http://localhost:22021/validator.w3.org</li>
<li>Select the Validate by Direct Input tab</li>
<li>Copy your full HTML document source code</li>
<li>Paste your HTML&nbsp; document source code into the text area</li>
<li>Click the Check button</li>
</ul>
Read through the errors carefully, they will point to the line that has the error and describe the error that is the problem.&nbsp; Warnings are of less concern, but you should be aware of them.&nbsp;</div>

<li>Select the Validate by File Upload tab</li>
<li>Click the Browse button and navigate to the location on your computer where you saved your file</li>

<p>If any of the error message seem like spaghetti soup to you, that's not unusual, check out http://localhost:22021/validator.w3.org/docs/help.html and of that doesn't help post the error message in the Learning Community along with the code causing the problem.</p>
