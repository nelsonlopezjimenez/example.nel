            <p>When you were very, very small the books that you read or were read to you included a lot of
                pictures.&nbsp; If you're old enough, you might enjoy a web site I ran across recently, <a
                    class="external" href="http://www.tagnwag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dick and Jane
                    Books</a>.</p>
            <p>However, as you grew, you found fewer pictures in the books.&nbsp; Then all the sudden books that you
                read for fun eliminated pictures.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; As our experiences grow, we are capable of creating
                these pictures in our own mind.&nbsp; We no longer need to be spoon-fed what our mind can now
                picture.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, there is a place and a time for pictures.&nbsp;When you are
                introduced to&nbsp;new concepts, topics and subjects, pictures or graphics are important.&nbsp; And many
                of us learn by visual stimulation, over written word.&nbsp; Eventually as you master a topic, you need
                fewer graphics, fewer picture examples.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So which is best?&nbsp; Graphics (pictures) or text?&nbsp; Well, there isn't&nbsp;just one&nbsp;answer to
                that question.&nbsp; Yes, we need graphics.&nbsp; Graphics make our pages interesting and
                enjoyable.&nbsp; Yes, we need designers to&nbsp;complete the user interface of a web site.&nbsp; Current
                statistics say you have 3 1/2 to 5 seconds to "grab" your viewer, so the color and layout of your site
                are very important!&nbsp; A great article on user interfaces can be found at: <a class="external"

                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Usability: Does Your Web Page Cause the Viewer to Think?</a>&nbsp; To
                be honest, would Canvas capture you and keep you here if it wasn't the importance of the content?</p>
            <p>Keeping your viewer at your page requires content or text!&nbsp; Getting your page to the top of search
                engine listings requires content or text!&nbsp; Search engines use web spiders or bots to index the
                content of a web site.&nbsp; They can't read graphics (they can read the alt attribute behind the
                graphic). Don't overlook your content.&nbsp; It is what keeps people coming.&nbsp; It is what makes you
                ranked number 1 on Goggle.</p>
            <p>Helpful hints in creating content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to get what your page is about in the first two sentences of your page's content.&nbsp; Give it
                    both a good value for the &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; element, as well as a good title to the
                    written part of your content.</li>
                <li>When working through the content of your page, try to determine what "keywords" might apply to
                    someone searching for you on the web.&nbsp; Get those keywords into your content.&nbsp; For those of
                    you that have worked with meta elements before, less value is now given to the keyword meta element
                    then to finding those words within your content.</li>
                <li>Make your content short.&nbsp; The general rule of thumb is you should not have more than one and
                    one half screen length scroll for your content.&nbsp; If you do, break up your content!</li>

                <h3><em><span style="color: #000000;">Resizing images&nbsp;</span></em></h3>
            </div>
            <p>(Note:&nbsp; This is an old set of notes from my XP box; please forgive, I didn't take the time to change
                the graphics.&nbsp; But I feel that you all can navigate to find the correct location for re-sizing in
                your current Windows systems.)</p>
            <p>In the traditional online classrooms, the first week of this quarter, I asked all students to post a Who
                Are We? short bio about yourself including a picture of either yourself or something important to
                you.&nbsp; At least half of the graphics received are huge!&nbsp; They always are, and I've become quite
                adept at resizing graphics.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the keys to making a successful web sites is is
                having a site that is quickly downloaded.&nbsp; Multimedia file sizes are important to achieving that
                key.&nbsp; Huge files take longer to download to your user and upload initially to the web server.&nbsp;
                While most of us in Western Washington have high speed internet connection, remember the rest of the
                world is catching up with us.&nbsp; Many places still use dial-up connections of 56 kbit/s (that's
                56,000 bits per second) or less.&nbsp; And rarely do actual dial-up speeds reach 56K.&nbsp;
                <br /><br />There are indeed times when you want to preserve your full graphic size (any photo site will
                want to do this), however, you should always initially present your graphics in smaller sizes, called
                thumbnails.&nbsp; I so often in the past have written pages and pages about these types of topics, often
                having to do a lot of research about the topics.&nbsp; Today, I seldom reinvent the wheel.&nbsp; Here
                are a few great articles I found on the web about images, resizing, and properties of images.</p>

            <p>And finally, a quick tutorial from me using Microsoft Paint. Microsoft Paint is shipped with every
                version of Windows.&nbsp; I am currently still on Windows XP on my home system, so the graphics and
                information provided below are relevant to Windows XP.&nbsp; I will attempt to add Windows 7 within the
                next few days as my netbook is using that operating system.<br /><br /></p>

            <p>Here's another take on resizing images, from Bucky Roberts of thenewboston.org.&nbsp; Remember: This is
                changing the very large image using the the height and width attributes.&nbsp; Remember that, this
                doesn't change the file size, if the file size is huge, you want create a thumbnail.<br /><br /></p>
