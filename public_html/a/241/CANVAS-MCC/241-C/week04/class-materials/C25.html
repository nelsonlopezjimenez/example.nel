            <p>When you were very, very small the books that you read or were read to you included a lot of pictures. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>However, as you grew, you found fewer pictures in the books.&nbsp; Then all the sudden books that you read for
                fun eliminated pictures.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; As our experiences grow, we are capable of creating these pictures
                in our own mind.&nbsp; We no longer need to be spoon-fed what our mind can now picture.&nbsp; Don't get me
                wrong, there is a place and a time for pictures.&nbsp;When you are introduced to&nbsp;new concepts, topics
                and subjects, pictures or graphics are important.&nbsp; And many of us learn by visual stimulation, over
                written word.&nbsp; Eventually as you master a topic, you need fewer graphics, fewer picture examples.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So which is best?&nbsp; Graphics (pictures) or text?&nbsp; Well, there isn't&nbsp;just one&nbsp;answer to that
                question.&nbsp; Yes, we need graphics.&nbsp; Graphics make our pages interesting and enjoyable.&nbsp; Yes,
                we need designers to&nbsp;complete the user interface of a web site.&nbsp; Current statistics say you have
                3 1/2 to 5 seconds to "grab" your viewer, so the color and layout of your site are very important! &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Keeping your viewer at your page requires content or text!&nbsp; Getting your page to the top of search engine
                listings requires content or text!&nbsp; Search engines use web spiders or bots to index the content of a
                web site.&nbsp; They can't read graphics (they can read the alt attribute behind the graphic). Don't overlook
                your content.&nbsp; It is what keeps people coming.&nbsp; It is what makes you ranked number 1 on Goggle.</p>
            <p>Helpful hints in creating content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to get what your page is about in the first two sentences of your page's content.&nbsp; Give it both
                    a good value for the &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; element, as well as a good title to the written part
                    of your content.</li>
                <li>When working through the content of your page, try to determine what "keywords" might apply to someone searching
                    for you on the web.&nbsp; Get those keywords into your content.&nbsp; For those of you that have worked
                    with meta elements before, less value is now given to the keyword meta element then to finding those
                    words within your content.</li>
                <li>Make your content short.&nbsp; The general rule of thumb is you should not have more than one and one half
                    screen length scroll for your content.&nbsp; If you do, break up your content!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>One of the keys to making a successful web sites is is having a site that is quickly downloaded.&nbsp; Multimedia
                file sizes are important to achieving that key.&nbsp; Huge files take longer to download to your user and
                upload initially to the web server.&nbsp; While most of us in Western Washington have high speed internet
                connection, remember the rest of the world is catching up with us.&nbsp; Many places still use dial-up connections
                of 56 kbit/s (that's 56,000 bits per second) or less.&nbsp; And rarely do actual dial-up speeds reach 56K.&nbsp;
                <br />
                <br />There are indeed times when you want to preserve your full graphic size (any photo site will want to do this),
                however, you should always initially present your graphics in smaller sizes, called thumbnails.&nbsp; I so
                often in the past have written pages and pages about these types of topics, often having to do a lot of research
                about the topics.&nbsp; Today, I seldom reinvent the wheel.&nbsp; Here are a few great articles I found on
                the web about images, resizing, and properties of images.</p>

            <p>And finally, a quick tutorial from me using Microsoft Paint. Microsoft Paint is shipped with every version of
                Windows.&nbsp; I am currently still on Windows XP on my home system, so the graphics and information provided
                below are relevant to Windows XP.&nbsp; I will attempt to add Windows 7 within the next few days as my netbook
                is using that operating system.

            <p>Here's another take on resizing images, from Bucky Roberts of thenewboston.org.&nbsp; Remember: This is changing
                the very large image using the the height and width attributes.&nbsp; Remember that, this doesn't change
                the file size, if the file size is huge, you want create a thumbnail.
