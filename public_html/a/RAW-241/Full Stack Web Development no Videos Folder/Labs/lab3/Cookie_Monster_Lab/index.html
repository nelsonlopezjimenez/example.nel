	<h1>Victoria's Journal</h1>
	<h2>So fresh and so clean</h2>

	<h2>04/09/08: Spatulas</h2>

	</p>

	<p>
		Yesterday I went to the store and got some much-needed <a href="http://edcc.edu/marksheet/index.html">spatulas</a>! (What better way to say I love myself than to buy myself a spatula?)
	</p>

	<h2>04/08/08: Cookie Monster Cupcakes</h2>
	<p>
		<img src="images/cookiemonster.jpg" alt="Cookie Monster: in cupcake form!" />
	</p>

	<p>
		My favorite cartoon character is Cookie Monster, and my favorite dessert is cupcakes, so Cookie Monster cupcakes are the best of both worlds.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Did you know? Cookie Monster once said, <q>Sometimes me think what is love, and then me think love is what last cookie is for. Me give up the last cookie for you.</q> I wonder if the same applies for cupcakes? (If so, I don't think I can ever love ANYONE!)
