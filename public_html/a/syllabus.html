<h3><i>Assessment and Grading Policies:</i></h3>
<p><i>How do you earn your grade?</i></p>
<p>Grading will be on a mix of the percentage of points available for discussion board (class participation),
	assignments, quizzes and tests, team participation. See the Grade Table below for the grade point equivalents.</p>
<p><i>What are the rules about late work?</i></p>
<p>With the exception of the final project/assignment, projects/assignments are due at the start of class on the date
	indicated in the Class Schedule. Projects/assignments received late will be marked 50% off if the assignment is not
	submitted by the stated date on the calendar. After the second week, no late assignment will be accepted. The final
	project will not be accepted late. No assignments will be accepted after the last class meeting of the quarter.</p>
<p>No make-up tests or quizzes will be given unless prearranged. Prearranged is defined as: notifying the instructor of
	the inability to take the test or quiz before the scheduled time of the test or quiz.</p>
<p>You must make up the missed test or quiz within an agreed upon amount of time, no more than one week.</p>
<h4>V grades and I Grades:</h4>
<p>V - An instructor-initiated withdrawal of a student. The final grade issued if an instructor initiates a class
	withdrawal before the end of the quarter, often in consultation with the student, or if a student enrolls in a class
	but never attends or stops attending class. A faculty member is under no obligation to grant an instructorinitiated
	withdrawal.</p>
<p>I - The incomplete is given at the discretion of the instructor only when the student has done satisfactory work but
	could not, for some unavoidable reason, complete some part of the coursework or take the final examination. The
	student and instructor prepare and sign an &ldquo;Incomplete Grade Contract&rdquo; (located in division offices)
	specifying the work to be completed. The contract will include the date by which all work must be submitted and the
	grade that will be submitted if the work is not completed. Incompletes given prior to Fall Quarter of 1990 will be
	assigned letter grades.</p>

<p>Course Policies: <i>Academic Honesty:</i></p>
<p>I will not tolerate cheating. Grades on assignments, quizzes or tests will be adjusted as warranted. Students who are
	suspected to have cheated will have a private talk with me and/or the division director. During or after this
	discussion we may make a suitable adjustment, if circumstances seem to warrant it. The following list is a sample of
	items that I consider to be cheating, but is not a complete list:</p>
<ul>
	<ul>
		<ul>
			<ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Any assignment OR test which is copied in whole or in part from another person.</li>
					<li>Plagiarism (please be sure that you know what this means).</li>
					<li>Using corrected exams to study for late test taking.</li>
					<li>Use of past test to study for test taking.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>Attendance:</i></strong> Because this is a mixed course, your "class participation" is your Discussion
	Board contributions. Generally there is a topic to be discussed each week of the course. The topics covered in this
	course can be difficult and require your attention and diligence. You should check in on the course at least 3 times
	a week, to be sure that you don't miss any important announcements or information. 10% of your grade is based upon
	your participation within this course.</p>
<h3><i>SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES</i></h3>
<p>If you require an accommodation for a disability, please contact Services for Students with Disabilities at MLT 159,
	425.640.1320 orssdmail@edcc.edu</p>
<h4><i>Student Civility Code and Online Etiquette Expectations</i></h4>
<p>I expect that students will conduct themselves in accordance with the Student Civility Code. The goal of the Student
	Civility Code is to improve the way Edmonds Community College educates students in the values of personal
	responsibility, consideration for others, and mutual respect in the presence of difference and disagreement. This
	means that everyone (students and faculty) should engage in courteous discourse - verbal and non-verbal, electronic
	and written. The primary way that communication will take place in our class is through email, discussions and
	assignment feedback. I will always communicate with you in a respectful manner and my expectation is that you will
	communicate with me and your classmates in the same way.</p>
