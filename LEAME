git remote set-url origin /c/Users/Public/canvas_file_cache/example.nel/.git
in change of /c/users/public/videos/example.nel/.git 
which are the same because of symlinks but just to be consistent with the configuration
in my class and other laptops. 
In short, 
the remote repo is in canvas_file_cache
the local repo is in documents somewhere in a folder with a name including "git"

A git remote add origin /c/somepath/to/someremote/repo/.git 
is when creating the remote. They say github, bitbucket or others but never mention another local location
Now I know.
